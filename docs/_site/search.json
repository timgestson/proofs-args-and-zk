We can use these values to compute a proof as well thanks to Sumcheck and the MatMult Protocol. We initiate the Counting Triangles Proof using these values along with \\(c\\).\n\n\nclass TriangleProver:\n    def __init__(self, a, a2, c):\n        self.a = a\n        self.a2 = a2\n        self.c = c\n        self.logn = int(log2(len(self.a)))\n        self.transcript = TrianglesTranscript()\n        self.transcript.write_a(self.a)\n\n\n\nNow we have to proove \\(\\tilde{a}^2 * \\tilde{a}\\) as the first phase of the protocol. We instantiate sumcheck and create a proof to add to the Counting Triangles transcript.\n\n\n    def prove(self):\n        p1 = SumcheckProver(\n            self.a2,\n            self.a,\n            self.c,\n            self.transcript.hashchain.copy(),\n        )\n        p1.prove()\n        self.transcript.add_transcript(p1.transcript)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe transcript.hashchain.copy() is just an implementation detail to make sure that the randomness is generated from a single fiat-shamir hashchain.\n\n\nNow that we have proved that computation, Thaler explains that we need to also prove that the \\(a^2\\) matrix was calculated correctly before we can make the final verification assertions. To do this, we run the MatMult IP.\n\n\n\n        rands = p1.transcript.randoms\n        (i, j) = (rands[: len(rands) // 2], rands[len(rands) // 2 :])\n\n        p2 = SumcheckProver(\n            [eval_mle(self.a, i + hc) for hc in hypercube(self.logn // 2)],\n            [eval_mle(self.a, hc + j) for hc in hypercube(self.logn // 2)],\n            eval_mle(self.a2, i + j),\n            p1.transcript.hashchain.copy(),\n        )\n        p2.prove()\n        self.transcript.add_transcript(p2.transcript)\n\n\n\nWe take the \\(r\\)s that the prover commited to in the first round of Sumcheck and set them to \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). Notice that we connot just pass in evaluations as-is like we did in the first Sumcheck instance. The MatMult IP is defined by: \\[fc(i,j)=∑{k\\in{\\{0,1\\}}} ^{log(n)} fa(i,k)·fb(k,j)\\] Here, \\(\\tilde{a}\\) is eqaul to \\(fa\\) and \\(fb\\) and we are summing up on the hypercube in order to instantiate a SumCheck instance that forces the Prover to commit to \\(k\\).\nNow that we have run sumcheck, we have \\(i\\), \\(j\\), and \\(k\\) so we theoretically have given the Verifier enough information to prove the validity of the computation. We would just need to evaluate \\(\\tilde{a}(i+j)\\), \\(\\tilde{a}(k+j)\\), and \\(\\tilde{a}(i+k)\\) to complete the Verification. This is alot of work for the Verifier though and it turns out that it can instead be done by the Prover.\n\n\nThe Useful Subroutine\nThaler describes a useful subroutine which allows work to be offloaded from the Verifier to the Prover. Let declare \\(\\ell\\) as the line going through points \\(\\tilde{W}(a)\\), \\(\\tilde{W}(b)\\), and \\(\\tilde{W}(c)\\).

    "text": "Efficient Sumcheck\n\nThe Prover\nWhen the sumcheck polynomial \\(g\\) is made up of the product of many different multilinear polynomials (in the form of \\(g = p_1 * p_2 ... p_k\\)), the prover can take advantage of a huge optimizations. The evaluations of \\(p_i\\) can be stored separately in the Prover’s internal data structure. Our implementation covers the scenario for when \\(g = p_1 * p_2\\) because that is all that is needed for counting triangles.\n\n\nclass SumcheckProver:\n\n    def __init__(self, p1, p2, c, randomness=None):\n        self.rounds = int(log2(len(p1)))\n        self.transcript = SumcheckTranscript(randomness)\n        self.c = c\n        self.p1 = p1\n        self.p2 = p2\n        self.rs = []\n\n\nWe start the Prover by storing the evaluations of \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Each round we can half the data structure leveraging Leema 3.8’s \\[p(x_1,x_2,...,x_l) = x_1 · p(1,x_2,...,x_l)+(1−x_1)· p(0,x_2,...,x_l)\\] Below is a visual from the book.\n\n\n\nSource: Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge\n\n\nThe Prover now sets \\(x_i\\) to \\(r\\) and updates its data structure in-place. Just like in the picture, we can devide the evaluations in half and zip those together in order to get the values we need for Lemma 3.8.\n\n\n    def execute_round(self, r):\n        self.rs.append(r)\n        half = len(self.p1) // 2\n        self.p1 = [\n            (Felt(1) - r) * a + r * b for (a, b) in zip(self.p1[:half], self.p1[half:])\n        ]\n        self.p2 = [\n            (Felt(1) - r) * a + r * b for (a, b) in zip(self.p2[:half], self.p2[half:])\n        ]\n        self.transcript.write_evaluations(self.evaluate_points())\n\n\nThe power of this is that we no longer have to sum up \\(x_{i+1}..x_l\\) on the hypercube to get the polynomial \\(S_i\\) to send to the prover. We can take advantage of the properties of the multilinear polynomial in order to save the Prover significant time.\n\n\n    def evaluate_points(self):\n        if len(self.p1) == 1:\n            return [Felt(0), self.p1[0] * self.p2[0], Felt(0)]\n\n        half = len(self.p1) // 2\n        zero, one, two = Felt(0), Felt(0), Felt(0)\n        for i in range(half):\n            zero += self.p1[i] * self.p2[i]\n            one += self.p1[half + i] * self.p2[half + i]\n            two += (Felt(2) * self.p1[half + i] - self.p1[i]) * (\n                Felt(2) * self.p2[half + i] - self.p2[i]\n            )\n        return [zero, one, two]\n\n\nSince the product of 2 multilinear polynomials will be quadratic (degree 2), we can specify \\(S_i\\) it by sending 3 points to the Verifier.

    "text": "Sumcheck\n\nThe Efficient Prover\nWhen the sumcheck polynomial \\(g\\) is made up of the product of many different multilinear polynomials (in the form of \\(g = p_1 * p_2 ... p_k\\)), the prover can take advantage of a huge optimizations. The evaluations of \\(p_i\\) can be stored separately in the Prover’s internal data structure. Our implementation covers the scenario for when \\(g = p_1 * p_2\\) because that is all that is needed for counting triangles.\n\n\nclass SumcheckProver:\n\n    def __init__(self, p1, p2, c, randomness=None):\n        self.rounds = int(log2(len(p1)))\n        self.transcript = SumcheckTranscript(randomness)\n        self.c = c\n        self.p1 = p1\n        self.p2 = p2\n        self.rs = []\n\n\nWe start the Prover by storing the evaluations of \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Each round we can half the data structure leveraging Leema 3.8’s \\[p(x_1,x_2,...,x_l) = x_1 · p(1,x_2,...,x_l)+(1−x_1)· p(0,x_2,...,x_l)\\] Below is a visual from the book.\n\n\n\nSource: Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge\n\n\nThe Prover now sets \\(x_i\\) to \\(r\\) and updates its data structure in-place. Just like in the picture, we can divide the evaluations in half and zip those together in order to get the values we need for Lemma 3.8.\n\n\n    def execute_round(self, r):\n        self.rs.append(r)\n        half = len(self.p1) // 2\n        self.p1 = [\n            (Felt(1) - r) * a + r * b for (a, b) in zip(self.p1[:half], self.p1[half:])\n        ]\n        self.p2 = [\n            (Felt(1) - r) * a + r * b for (a, b) in zip(self.p2[:half], self.p2[half:])\n        ]\n        self.transcript.write_evaluations(self.evaluate_points())\n\n\nThe power of this is that we no longer have to sum up \\(x_{i+1}..x_l\\) on the hypercube to get the polynomial \\(S_i\\) to send to the prover. We can take advantage of the properties of the multilinear polynomial in order to save the Prover significant time.\n\n\n    def evaluate_points(self):\n        if len(self.p1) == 1:\n            return [Felt(0), self.p1[0] * self.p2[0], Felt(0)]\n\n        half = len(self.p1) // 2\n        zero, one, two = Felt(0), Felt(0), Felt(0)\n        for i in range(half):\n            zero += self.p1[i] * self.p2[i]\n            one += self.p1[half + i] * self.p2[half + i]\n            two += (Felt(2) * self.p1[half + i] - self.p1[i]) * (\n                Felt(2) * self.p2[half + i] - self.p2[i]\n            )\n        return [zero, one, two]\n\n\nSince the product of 2 multilinear polynomials will be quadratic (degree 2), we can specify \\(S_i\\) it by sending 3 points to the Verifier. Thaler gives us a way to do this in a single pass by using the fact that the leading bit will be \\(0\\) for the first half of the evaluations and \\(1\\) for the second half.
